                NAIROBI, Kenya, Oct 17  Taxi drivers in Kenya have come together to form an association(TAXI KENYA) that brings together members drawn from the 47 counties in Kenya to address their welfare.
            
                The association known as TAXI KENYA will comprise Taxi and UBER drivers. 
                
                The new association’s interim chairman Mr. Mathew Maingi who is also the chairman of the Nyeri ubers said the drivers  have come together to give themselves a collective voice for positive change in their industry through effective engagement with the government.
                
                According to Maingi, the association has already set up county committees and identified representatives from eight counties namely Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, Kwale, Kilifi, Nyeri, and Kiambu.
                
                Maingi further disclosed that they expect to inaugurate all county committees within the coming 30 days followed by a national conference at a date to be announced later.
                
                “For far too long, taxi drivers in Kenya have not had a strong voice to provide input about regulations and policies that affect their livelihood. This association will give them the strong voice they need and deserve,” said Maingi.
                
                During a forum in a Mombasa Hotel on Monday, the Taxi leadership also lauded the government for the gazettement of the Transport Regulations that govern the taxi industry.
                
                They called on the government through National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) to ensure that the implementation of the regulations was done in consultation and participation of the industry stakeholders.
                
                Mr. David Mwangi, secretary to the novel association observed that while everyone has a right to conduct business in the Country, the drivers wish to have a fair, level playing field across the various taxi mobile applications for them to compete fairly.
